# Kapatal SaltStack State
This SaltStack state file automates the configuration of a standard development environment for the `kapatal` user.
This feature enables users to swiftly execute a range of tasks, including package installations, configuration of user and permission settings, management of environment variables, and software installation.

---

## Content
- User creation and sudo authorization settings  
- Installation of basic packages (curl, git, htop, etc.)  
- Flatpak and Snap installations and configuration  
- Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh setup and settings  
- Python tools and virtual environment setup  
- Node.js (with NVM) and Yarn setup  
- Microsoft VSCode setup

---

## Requirements
- SaltStack Master and Minion must be installed and communicating.
- User and file permissions must be set appropriately.
- Internet connection required (for package downloads and scripts)

---

## Notes
- In oh-my-zsh installation, root user specific directory control is done. For user-based installation, changes may be required on state.
- NVM installation and Node.js settings are done under the `kapatal` user.
- For sudo authorization, the contents of `/etc/sudoers.d/kapatal` file should be in `kapatalfiles/kapatal-sudo`.
